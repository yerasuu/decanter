# Windows support (future option)

Not planned yet; recorded on 2026-10-12 as an option, with what it would
take. Decanter and psport are Linux-only today.

## Decanter: medium effort

Most of it is portable already: GPUI runs on Windows (Zed ships there) and
the code is Rust with portable crates. The Linux-specific parts have known
equivalents:

| Linux today | Windows |
|---|---|
| Proton / `umu-run` for GOG and external games | not needed: they run natively, which simplifies launching |
| Galaxy64 hook under Wine | works natively |
| One systemd scope per game | Job Objects |
| Per-game `.desktop` + symlink for the Plasma taskbar | shortcuts with a per-game AppUserModelID |
| `flock` runtime lock in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` | `LockFileEx` |
| Keyring | Windows Credential Manager (the keyring crate supports it) |
| Tray via ksni | a cross-platform tray crate |
| `~/.config/decanter/libraries.toml` | `%APPDATA%\decanter\libraries.toml` |

The data-in-library layout and the Steam export carry over as they are.
Decanter has almost no `cfg(windows)` code today.

## psport: high effort, with prior art

In favour: the GPU side comes from shadPS4, which runs on Windows, and
there is a Windows port of bbport by Supermedo (the source of psport's
DLSS bridge).

The work is the runtime's platform layer (`src/`):

- **TLS**: PS4 code reads its TLS through `fs`; on Linux psport patches it
  to `gs`. On Windows x64 `gs` is the TEB and can't be repointed from user
  mode. The main technical question; Supermedo's port solves it somehow.
- **Memory**: fixed-address mappings, direct memory and the guest memory
  shared with Vulkan (dma-buf/memfd on Linux) become `VirtualAlloc`, file
  mappings and Vulkan's Win32 external memory.
- **Signals**: write traps and the Unity GC's thread suspension become
  vectored exception handlers and `SuspendThread`/`GetThreadContext`.
- **Threads, files, build**: pthreads to Win32; the Nix toolchain to CMake
  with clang-cl or MinGW and vcpkg.

17 files already have `_WIN32` guards, mostly stubs ("Windows backend not
implemented").

## Ongoing cost

Two platforms to test; today all game testing (headless gamescope,
`tools/regress.sh`) is Linux-only.

## Suggested order, if pursued

1. Meanwhile: keep new psport code free of Linux-isms outside a clear
   platform layer.
2. Decanter on Windows for GOG and external games (best value for effort).
3. psport on Windows after studying how Supermedo's port handles TLS and
   memory (a read-only feasibility study first).
